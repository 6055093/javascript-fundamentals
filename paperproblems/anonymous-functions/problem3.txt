Rewrite this program so that it doesn't have a single function definition
In other words, replace all the function definitions with anonymous functions
Use arrow functions.
The 'function' keyword should not appear in your program


function greet(x, y) {
    console.log("hello " + x + " " + y);
}

function call(f) {
    f("Bob", "Dole");
}

call(greet);
